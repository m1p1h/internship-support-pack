# Internship Starter Pack

Overview

This repository aims to provide SDE Team Development Hub interns with a roadmap to key project information and training support available across relevant SDE competency domains (e.g. Cloud & Infrastructure, Security & Compliance). In addition, it will aim to provide up-to-date materials and documentation on each project partner's divergent SDE infrastructure. 

# SDE Team Development Hub
The SDE Team Development Hub is a collaboration between like-minded individuals that aims to find better ways to develop and support Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) that underpin the creation of Secure Data Environments (SDEs). The project is funded through an EPSRC grant and is led by the University of Manchester in collaboration with Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Liverpool.

# Key Contacts & Team Structure
Each intern will be resident at one of the three partner sitorganisations and will report to the designated team co-I. Further information on the wider project team can be found [here](https://uom-data-science-platforms.github.io/sde-skills/about/).

# Internship Goals/Expectations
- Gain novel experiences across three diverse SDE development teams
- Feedback to the project your experiences and engage with the project 'reflections' process throughout the internship
- Engage and share experiences through internship cohort engagement activities (e.g. hackathons, show & tell sessions, etc) 


# Reflective Journal
Reflective writing is good practice in a learning or training environment and can play a key role in identifying and developing your personal development and career goals. As an intern on the project you will use a logbook as your reflections document. The project aims to develop and test a skills framework and curriculum; hence, the journal is of particular importance as it will form an opportunity to record: 

- Activities, learnings and progress of your project and assignments 
- Feedback on your experience of the training repository, competency framework and curriculum 
- Other thoughts, reflections, ideas  
- Relevant materials built up over a period of time  

This can help you to: 

- Gain insight into your own learning and performance on the programme 
- Interpret and evaluate key aspects of your experience or learning as part of the Skillshub Programme 
- Identify and analyse themes or focus areas, and inform your future practice 
- Help to test and develop a new competency framework for technical professionals like you 

Please review the reflective process guidance and periodically complete the journal template provided [here](assets/Reflective-log-Guidance-and-Template.docx).
