# Internship Starter Pack

Overview

This repository aims to provide SDE Team Development Hub interns with a roadmap to key project information and training support available across relevant SDE competency domains (e.g. Cloud & Infrastructure, Security & Compliance). In addition, it will aim to provide up-to-date materials and documentation on each project partner's divergent SDE infrastructure. 

# SDE Team Development Hub
The SDE Team Development Hub is a collaboration between like-minded individuals that aims to find better ways to develop and support Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) that underpin the creation of Secure Data Environments (SDEs). The project is funded through an EPSRC grant and is led by the University of Manchester in collaboration with Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Liverpool.
